# Summary:

# Kmeans

1) random assign a class to each point

2) repeat until the algorithm dosent change

2.1) Assign a centroid to each cluster

2.2) Assign each point to the closest centroid (euclidean distance)


Local minium in each group. The function is not convex, so no global optimum

# Hierarchical Clustering

1) Start each point in its own cluster

2) Identify the closets two clusters and merge then

3) Repeat

4) End when all points are in a single cluster
