Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

*Answer:* Nothing, because there is no GEOM + AES loaded.

``` r
  # corrected code
  #View(mpg)

  ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy))+
  geom_point()
```

How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

``` r
  # 234 rows and 11 columns
  str(mpg)

What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

``` r
  ?mpg
```

    ## starting httpd help server ... done

``` r
  # DRV = the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
```

Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

``` r
  ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy,cyl))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()
```

What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot
not useful?

``` r
#Both categorical variables, scatterplot usually shows some relations between variables, but to get better results with one continuos.
  ggplot(mpg, aes(class,drv))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()

What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

``` r

Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous?
(Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you
see this information when you run mpg?

Answer: - Continuos: displ, year, cty, hwy - Categorical: manufacturer,
model, trans, drv, fl, class

``` r
#Look for variables NON-Numeric => categorical
str(mpg)

Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these
aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?

``` r
#shape => dosent accept continuos 
# size and color => accpect but i will not recommend for continuos variables with many values!
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty, size = year))
```

![](R_DS_Ex_Ch03_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

``` r
#it will be shown the same information.... lot of unecessary visual with no value added!
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, size = class, shape = class))
```

    ## Warning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised.

    ## Warning: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because
    ## more than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate; you have 7. Consider
    ## specifying shapes manually if you must have them.

    ## Warning: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint:
use ?geom\_point)

``` r
#stroke = define the size of the points...
  ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, stroke = 2 , color = class, shape = class))
```

What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable
name, like aes(colour = displ \< 5)? Note, you’ll also need to specify x
and y.

``` r
  #Split variable COLOR to true or false with logical conditional 
  ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, stroke = 2 , colour = displ < 5, shape = class == "minivan"))

What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?

What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour
aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if
you had a larger dataset?

*Answer: Faceting shows a more visual graph, where u can see the details
of each point inside the “class”. With color u compare the position
between the “classes”. If u have a larger dataset with a lot of points
and few classes, faceting is better because u can\`t see the diferences
in the same plot.*

Read ?facet\_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other
options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t
facet\_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?

*Answer: nrow and ncol define how to display the plots. Face grid dosent
have because they ajust only by variables numbers, for example a
variable with 4 variables will have 4 columns/rows.*

When using facet\_grid() you should usually put the variable with more
unique levels in the columns. Why?

*Answer: When putting the more levels on the row axis, then the y-axis
would shrink so that it is harder to see which actual values are at the
points as shown in the plot *

## 3.6.1 Exercises

What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An

What does show.legend = FALSE do? What happens if you remove it? Why do
you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

What does the se argument to geom\_smooth() do?

\*Answer: SE = Standard deviation, its like a band around the line,
showing the standard devation on that function.

Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

*Answer: No Same graphs, the definition on AES on GGPlot put this X and

What does geom\_col() do? How is it different to geom\_bar()?

*Answer: The geom\_col() function has different default stat than
geom\_bar(). The default stat of geom\_col() is stat\_identity(), which
leaves the data as is. The geom\_col() function expects that the data
contains x values and y values which represent the bar height.*

*The default stat of geom\_bar() is stat\_count(). The geom\_bar()
function only expects an x variable. The stat, stat\_count(),
preprocesses input data by counting the number of observations for each
value of x. The y aesthetic uses the values of these counts.*

Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in
concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the
pairs. What do they have in common?

*Answer: These pairs of geoms and stats tend to have their names in
common, such stat\_smooth() and geom\_smooth() and be documented on the
same help page. The pairs of geoms and stats that are used in concert
often have each other as the default stat (for a geom) or geom (for a
stat).*

What variables does stat\_smooth() compute? What parameters control its
behaviour?

Answer: The function stat\_smooth() calculates the following variables:

  - y: predicted value
  - ymin: lower value of the confidence interval
  - ymax: upper value of the confidence interval
  - se: standard error \*\*\*

In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other
words what is the problem with these two graphs?

*Answer: we need to put group = 1 or y=..group.. to avoid proportion
inside the group. For example, in FAIR how is the proportion of FAIR? It
dosent make sense, using group = 1 u pick proportion of samples inside
the variable, for example FAIR in CUT*

ggplot(data = diamonds) +

## 3.8.1 Exercises

What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?

``` r

  geom_point()

  geom_jitter()
```

![](R_DS_Ex_Ch03_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png)<!-- -->

What parameters to geom\_jitter() control the amount of jittering?

*ANSWER: From the geom\_jitter() documentation, there are two arguments
to jitter:*

  - width controls the amount of horizontal displacement, and
  - height controls the amount of vertical displacement.
  - The defaults values of width and height will introduce noise in both
    directions. Here is what the plot looks like with the default values
    of height and width.

Compare and contrast geom\_jitter() with geom\_count().

``` r
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +

What does labs() do? Read the documentation.

*The labs function adds axis titles, plot titles, and a caption to the
plot.* *The labs() function is not the only function that adds titles to
plots. The xlab(), ylab(), and x- and y-scale functions can add axis
titles. The ggtitle() function adds plot titles.*

What’s the difference between coord\_quickmap() and coord\_map()?

*answer: The coord\_map() function uses map projections to project the
three-dimensional Earth onto a two-dimensional plane. By default,
coord\_map() uses the Mercator projection. This projection is applied to
all the geoms in the plot. The coord\_quickmap() function uses an
approximate but faster map projection. This approximation ignores the
curvature of Earth and adjusts the map for the latitude/longitude ratio.
The coord\_quickmap() project is faster than coord\_map() both because
the projection is computationally easier, and unlike coord\_map(), the
coordinates of the individual geoms do not need to be transformed.*

What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city
and highway mpg? Why is coord\_fixed() important? What does
geom\_abline() do?

*Answer: The function coord\_fixed() ensures that the line produced by
geom\_abline() is at a 45-degree angle. A 45-degree line makes it easy
to compare the highway and city mileage to the case in which city and
highway MPG were equal.*
