### Quick Guide to Transformation Functions:

- Pick observations by their values (filter()).
```{r}
  filter(mtcars, mpg > 20)
```


- Reorder the rows (arrange()).
```{r}
head(arrange(mtcars, cyl))
```



- Pick variables by their names (select()).
```{r}
# Select columns by name
head(select(mtcars, mpg, cyl, hp))
```


- Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)

mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60 )
```

- Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Further Reading;

# Exploratory Data Analysis;
Read chapter from the suggested book about the checklist:
https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/exploratory-data-analysis-checklist.html


## Peng Check-List
1. Formulate your question

2. Read in your data

3. Check the packaging

4. Run str()

5. Look at the top and the bottom of your data

6. Check your “n”s

7. Validate with at least one external data source

8. Try the easy solution first

9. Challenge your solution

10. Follow up

## Tuckey Principles

1. Show comparisons

2. Show Causality

3. Show Multivariate Data

4. Integrate Evidence

5. Describe and Document the evidence

6. Content, content, content
