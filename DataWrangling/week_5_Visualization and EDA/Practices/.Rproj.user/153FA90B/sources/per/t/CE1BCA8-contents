# Chapter 3: Data Visualisation

## 3.2.4 Exercises

Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?  

*Answer:* Nothing, because there is no GEOM + AES loaded.

```{r}
  # corrected code
  #View(mpg)

  ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer, y = hwy))+
  geom_point()
```


How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

```{r}
  # 234 rows and 11 columns
  str(mpg)
```


What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

```{r}
  ?mpg

  # DRV = the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
```

Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

```{r}
  ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy,cyl))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()
```


What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
```{r}
#Both categorical variables, scatterplot usually shows some relations between variables, but to get better results with one continuos.
  ggplot(mpg, aes(class,drv))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()
```


  ## 3.3.1 Exercises

What’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?



```{r}
#Color inside the AES, determine CLASS of points, usually is used by other variable to describe or add informations
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```


Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset). How can you see this information when you run mpg?

Answer:
- Continuos: displ, year, cty, hwy
- Categorical: manufacturer, model, trans, drv, fl, class
```{r}
#Look for variables NON-Numeric => categorical
str(mpg)
```


Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?
```{r}
#shape => dosent accept continuos 
# size and color => accpect but i will not recommend for continuos variables with many values!
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty, size = year))
```


What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?

```{r}
#it will be shown the same information.... lot of unecessary visual with no value added!
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, size = class, shape = class))
```


What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)

```{r}
#stroke = define the size of the points...
  ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, stroke = 2 , color = class, shape = class))
```


What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)? Note, you’ll also need to specify x and y.

```{r}
  #Split variable COLOR to true or false with logical conditional 
  ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, stroke = 2 , colour = displ < 5, shape = class == "minivan"))
```


## 3.5.1 Exercises
What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
```{r}
  #Lot of messy visual... each region of facet is probably one observation
  ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))+
    facet_wrap(~displ)
```


What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))
```

```{r}
 #there is no match value with DRV and CYL with this values
 ggplot(data = mpg) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))+
    facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

  #check if values exists => in fact there is no obervation
  filter(mpg, drv == 5 & cyl == 4)
```

```{r}

```

What plots does the following code make? What does . do?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```


Take the first faceted plot in this section:
```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) 
```


What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?

*Answer: Faceting shows a more visual graph, where u can see the details of each point inside the "class". With color u compare the position between the "classes". If u have a larger dataset with a lot of points and few classes, faceting is better because u can`t see the diferences in the same plot.*


Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?

*Answer: nrow and ncol define how to display the plots. Face grid dosent have because they ajust only by variables numbers, for example a variable with 4 variables will have 4 columns/rows.*

When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?

*Answer: When putting the more levels on the row axis, then the y-axis would shrink so that it is harder to see which actual values are at the points as shown in the plot *

## 3.6.1 Exercises
What geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram? An area chart?

*Answer; geom_line, geom_boxplot, geom_hist, geom_area*

Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

x
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
  
What does show.legend = FALSE do? What happens if you remove it?
Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?

*Answer; The theme option show.legend = FALSE hides the legend box. It should be use inside the geom_funcion!*
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +

  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) 

  
```


What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?

*Answer: SE = Standard deviation, its like a band around the line, showing the standard devation on that function.

Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?

*Answer: No Same graphs, the definition on AES on GGPlot put this X and Y as default values to every GEOM_ added latter. As in this case the AES on the second code, is the same arguments the graphs are the same.*  

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()


```
```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Recreate the codes to generate the following graphs;
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Exercise 3.6.6", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("exercise366.png")
```
```{r}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "blue")
```

```{r}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = drv), se = FALSE) 

```
```{r}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 
```
```{r}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv), size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 
```

```{r}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE) 
```

```{r}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = "white", size = 4) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))

```

  
## 3.7.1 Exercises

What is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?

```{r}
# PRevious plot
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_pointrange(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    stat = "summary",
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```


What does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?

*Answer: The geom_col() function has different default stat than geom_bar(). The default stat of geom_col() is stat_identity(), which leaves the data as is. The geom_col() function expects that the data contains x values and y values which represent the bar height.*

*The default stat of geom_bar() is stat_count(). The geom_bar() function only expects an x variable. The stat, stat_count(), preprocesses input data by counting the number of observations for each value of x. The y aesthetic uses the values of these counts.* 

Most geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs. What do they have in common?

*Answer: These pairs of geoms and stats tend to have their names in common, such stat_smooth() and geom_smooth() and be documented on the same help page. The pairs of geoms and stats that are used in concert often have each other as the default stat (for a geom) or geom (for a stat).*

What variables does stat_smooth() compute? What parameters control its behaviour?

Answer: The function stat_smooth() calculates the following variables: 

- y: predicted value
- ymin: lower value of the confidence interval
- ymax: upper value of the confidence interval
- se: standard error ***

In our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1. Why? In other words what is the problem with these two graphs?

_Answer: we need to put group = 1 or y=..group.. to avoid proportion inside the group. For example, in FAIR how is the proportion of FAIR? It dosent make sense, using group = 1 u pick proportion of samples inside the variable, for example FAIR in CUT_

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))
```
```{r}
#correct example
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..group.., fill = cut))
```
  
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))
```

  
## 3.8.1 Exercises
What is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?


```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
#using geom_jitter you put random variation to the location, and show much more clearly avoiding overplotting
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_jitter()
```

What parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?

*ANSWER: From the geom_jitter() documentation, there are two arguments to jitter:*

- width controls the amount of horizontal displacement, and
- height controls the amount of vertical displacement.
- The defaults values of width and height will introduce noise in both directions. Here is what the plot looks like with the default values of height and width.

Compare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_count()
```


## 3.9.1 Exercises

Turn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using coord_polar().
*ANswer: A pie chart is a stacked bar chart with the addition of polar coordinates. Take this stacked bar chart with a single category.*

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = factor(1), fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar()
```
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = factor(1), fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
```



What does labs() do? Read the documentation.

*The labs function adds axis titles, plot titles, and a caption to the plot.*
*The labs() function is not the only function that adds titles to plots. The xlab(), ylab(), and x- and y-scale functions can add axis titles. The ggtitle() function adds plot titles.*

What’s the difference between coord_quickmap() and coord_map()?

*answer: The coord_map() function uses map projections to project the three-dimensional Earth onto a two-dimensional plane. By default, coord_map() uses the Mercator projection. This projection is applied to all the geoms in the plot. The coord_quickmap() function uses an approximate but faster map projection. This approximation ignores the curvature of Earth and adjusts the map for the latitude/longitude ratio. The coord_quickmap() project is faster than coord_map() both because the projection is computationally easier, and unlike coord_map(), the coordinates of the individual geoms do not need to be transformed.*

What does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?

*Answer: The function coord_fixed() ensures that the line produced by geom_abline() is at a 45-degree angle. A 45-degree line makes it easy to compare the highway and city mileage to the case in which city and highway MPG were equal.*

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() +
  coord_fixed()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline() 
```
