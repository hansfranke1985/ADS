```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Importing libraries

```{r }
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR)
```


## Question 1


## Question 2:
### Run the code below to generate data. There will be three vectors in your environment. Put them in a data frame for entering it in a ggplot() call using either the data.frame() or the tibble() function. Give informative names and make sure the types are correct (use the as.<type>() functions). Name the result gg_students

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
student_grade  <- rnorm(32, 7)
student_number <- round(runif(32) * 2e6 + 5e6)
programme      <- sample(c("Science", "Social Science"), 32, replace = TRUE)
```

Converting to DataFrame:

```{r}
gg_students <- tibble( 
                        student_grade = student_grade, 
                        student_number = student_number, 
                        programme = programme
                        )
```

Print Head of DF:
```{r}
head(gg_students)
```

## Question 2
### Plot the first homeruns_plot again, but map the Hits to the y-axis and the HmRun to the x-axis instead.
