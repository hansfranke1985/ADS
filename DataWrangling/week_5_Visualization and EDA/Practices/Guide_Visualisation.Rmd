- Pick observations by their values (filter()).
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```


- Reorder the rows (arrange()).
```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```


- Pick variables by their names (select()).
```{r}
# Select columns by name
select(flights, year, month, day)
```


- Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)

mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60 )
```

- Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
