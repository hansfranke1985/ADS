```


Importing libraries

```{r }
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR)
```


## Question 1


## Question 2:
### Run the code below to generate data. There will be three vectors in your environment. Put them in a data frame for entering it in a ggplot() call using either the data.frame() or the tibble() function. Give informative names and make sure the types are correct (use the as.<type>() functions). Name the result gg_students

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
student_grade  <- rnorm(32, 7)
student_number <- round(runif(32) * 2e6 + 5e6)
programme      <- sample(c("Science", "Social Science"), 32, replace = TRUE)
```

Converting to DataFrame:

```{r}
gg_students <- tibble( 
                        student_grade = student_grade, 
                        student_number = student_number, 
                        programme = programme
                        )
```

Print Head of DF:
```{r}
head(gg_students)
```

## Question 2
### Plot the first homeruns_plot again, but map the Hits to the y-axis and the HmRun to the x-axis instead.

```{r}
homeruns_plot <- 
  ggplot(Hitters, aes(x = HmRun, y = Hits)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "HmRun", y = "Hits")

homeruns_plot
```

## Question 4:
### Recreate the same plot once more, but now also map the variable League to the colour aesthetic and the variable Salary to the size aesthetic.

```{r}
homeruns_plot2 <- 
  ggplot(Hitters, aes(x = HmRun, y = Hits, colour = League, size = Salary)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "HmRun", y = "Hits")

homeruns_plot2           
```

## question 5:
### Look at the many different geoms on the reference website.
https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms

## Question 6:
### Use geom_histogram() to create a histogram of the grades of the students in the gg_students dataset. Play around with the binwidth argument of the geom_histogram() function.


```{r}
 gg_students_plot <- 
  ggplot(gg_students, aes(x = student_grade))+
  geom_histogram() +
  stat_bin(binwidth = NULL)
  
gg_students_plot 
```

```{r}
gg_students_plot <- 
  ggplot(gg_students, aes(x = student_grade))+
  geom_histogram() +
  stat_bin(binwidth = 1)
  
gg_students_plot 
```

## Question 7
### Use geom_density() to create a density plot of the grades of the students in the gg_students dataset. Add the argument fill = "light seagreen" to geom_density()

```{r}
gg_students_plot_3 <- 
  ggplot(gg_students, aes(student_grade))+
 
  geom_density(fill = "light seagreen")


  
gg_students_plot_3 
```

## Question 8:
### Add rug marks to the density plot through geom_rug(). You can edit the colour and size of the rug marks using those arguments within the geom_rug() function.

```{r}
gg_students_plot_3 <- 
  ggplot(gg_students, aes(student_grade))+
 
  geom_density(fill = "light seagreen")+
  geom_rug(colour='red', size=2)


  
gg_students_plot_3
```

## Question 9:
Increase the data to ink ratio by removing the y axis label, setting the theme to theme_minimal(), and removing the border of the density polygon. Also set the limits of the x-axis to go from 0 to 10 using the xlim() function, because those are the plausible values for a student grade.

```{r}
gg_students_plot_4 <- 
  ggplot(gg_students, aes(student_grade))+ 
 
  xlim(0,10)+
  labs(y = NULL) + 
  geom_density(fill = "light seagreen", outline.type = "lower")+
  geom_rug(colour='red', size=2)+
  theme_minimal()

  
gg_students_plot_4
```

## Question 10
Create a boxplot of student grades per programme in the gg_students dataset you made earlier: map the programme variable to the x position and the grade to the y position. For extra visual aid, you can additionally map the programme variable to the fill aesthetic



## Question 11
What do each of the horizontal lines in the boxplot mean? What do the vertical lines (whiskers) mean?
