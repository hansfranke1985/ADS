# Summary:

## Data Quality

- Accuracy => data was recorded correctly
- Completeness => all relevant data was recorded
- Uniqueness => Entities are recorded once
- Timeliness => the data is keep up to date
- Consistency => the data agrees with itself


## Statistical Approaches

1. Parametric:

- Minimal likelihood Formula (X - mean ) / std ==> if the value is 3x more than std, there is an outlier


2. Non-Parametric:

- Histogram 
- Density 

## Distance Based Approaches

General Idea:  
- Judge a point based on the distance(s) to its neighbors
- Several variants proposed
Basic Assumption:  
- Normal data objects have a dense neighborhood
- Outliers are far apart from their neighbors, i.e., have a less dense neighborhood

## Density based approaches
General Idea:  
- Compare the density around a point with the density around its local neighbors
- The relative density of a point compared to its neighbors is computed as an outlier score
- Approaches essentially differ in how to estimate density
Basic Assumption:  
- The density around a normal data object is similar to the density around its neighbors
- The density around an outlier is considerably different to the density around its neighbors 

## Model base approaches

- Data points that do not conform to the fitting model are potential
outliers

- linear reg / logistic reg / ...

# Outliers

## 12.1.1 What Are Outliers?
An outlier is a data object that deviates significantly from the rest of the objects, as if it were generated by a different mechanism. For ease of presentation within this chapter, we may refer to data objects that are not outliers as “normal” or expected data. Similarly, we may refer to outliers as “abnormal” data

Outliers are different from noisy data. As mentioned in Chapter 3, noise is a random error or variance in a measured variable. In general, noise is not interesting in
data analysis, including outlier detection. 

## 12.1.2 Types of Outliers 

- Global:
In a given data set, a data object is a global outlierif it deviates significantly from the rest of the data set. Global outliers are sometimes called point anomalies, and are the simplest type of outliers. Most outlier detection methods are aimed at finding global outliers.  

- Context
In a given data set, a data object is a contextual outlier if it deviates significantly with respect to a specific context of the object. Contextual outliers are also known as
conditional outliers because they are conditional on the selected context 

- Collective
Given a data set, a subset of data objects forms a collective outlier if the objects as a whole deviate significantly from the entire data set. Importantly, the individual data
objects may not be outliers.


- Local

## Challenges of Outlier Detection 

- Modeling normal objects and outliers effectively
- Application-specific outlier detection
- Handling noise in outlier detection
- Understandability

## Outlier Detection Methods 

### supervised
1. definition: Supervised methods model data normality and abnormality. Domain experts examine and label a sample of the underlying data. Outlier detection can then be modeled as a classification problem

2. challenges:
- In summary, supervised methods of outlier detection must be careful in how they train and how they interpret classification rates due to the fact that outliers are rare in
comparison to the other data samples

### Semi-Supervised 
In many applications, although obtaining some labeled examples is feasible, the number of such labeled examples is often small. We may encounter cases where only a small set
of the normal and/or outlier objects are labeled, but most of the data are unlabeled. Semi-supervised outlier detection methods were developed to tackle such scenarios.

### Unsupervised Methods 
Unsupervised outlier detection methods make an implicit assumption: The normal objects are somewhat “clustered.” In other words, an unsupervised outlier detection
method expects that normal objects follow a pattern far more frequently than outliers. Normal objects do not have to fall into one group sharing high similarity. Instead, they
can form multiple groups, where each group has distinct features. However, an outlier is expected to occur far away in feature space from any of those groups of normal objects

## 12.2.2 Statistical Methods, Proximity-Based Methods, and Clustering-Based Methods 551
According to the assumptions made, we can categorize outlier detection methods into three types: statistical methods, proximity-based methods, and clustering-based methods.

- Statistical methods (also known as model-based methods) make assumptions of data normality. They assume that normal data objects are generated by a statistical (stochastic) model, and that data not following the model are outliers.

- Proximity-based methods assume that an object is an outlier if the nearest neighbors of the object are far away in feature space, that is, the proximity of the object to its
neighbors significantly deviates from the proximity of most of the other objects to their neighbors in the same data set.

- Clustering-based methods assume that the normal data objects belong to large and dense clusters, whereas outliers belong to small or sparse clusters, or do not belong to
any clusters.
