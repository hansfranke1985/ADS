# Summary:

## Data Quality

- Accuracy => data was recorded correctly
- Completeness => all relevant data was recorded
- Uniqueness => Entities are recorded once
- Timeliness => the data is keep up to date
- Consistency => the data agrees with itself


## Statistical Approaches

1. Parametric:

- Minimal likelihood Formula (X - mean ) / std ==> if the value is 3x more than std, there is an outlier


2. Non-Parametric:

- Histogram 
- Density 

## Distance Based Approaches

General Idea:  
- Judge a point based on the distance(s) to its neighbors
- Several variants proposed
Basic Assumption:  
- Normal data objects have a dense neighborhood
- Outliers are far apart from their neighbors, i.e., have a less dense neighborhood

## Density based approaches
General Idea:  
- Compare the density around a point with the density around its local neighbors
- The relative density of a point compared to its neighbors is computed as an outlier score
- Approaches essentially differ in how to estimate density
Basic Assumption:  
- The density around a normal data object is similar to the density around its neighbors
- The density around an outlier is considerably different to the density around its neighbors 

## Model base approaches

- Data points that do not conform to the fitting model are potential
outliers

- linear reg / logistic reg / ...


# Review

- Data reduction
- Dimensionality reduction
- Numerosity reduction
- Data compression
- Data transformation and data discretization
- Normalization


# Outliers

## 12.1.1 What Are Outliers?
An outlier is a data object that deviates significantly from the rest of the objects, as if it were generated by a different mechanism. For ease of presentation within this chapter, we may refer to data objects that are not outliers as “normal” or expected data. Similarly, we may refer to outliers as “abnormal” data

Outliers are different from noisy data. As mentioned in Chapter 3, noise is a random error or variance in a measured variable. In general, noise is not interesting in
data analysis, including outlier detection. 

## 12.1.2 Types of Outliers 

- Global:
In a given data set, a data object is a global outlierif it deviates significantly from the rest of the data set. Global outliers are sometimes called point anomalies, and are the simplest type of outliers. Most outlier detection methods are aimed at finding global outliers.  

- Context
In a given data set, a data object is a contextual outlier if it deviates significantly with respect to a specific context of the object. Contextual outliers are also known as
conditional outliers because they are conditional on the selected context 

- Collective
Given a data set, a subset of data objects forms a collective outlier if the objects as a whole deviate significantly from the entire data set. Importantly, the individual data
objects may not be outliers.


- Local

## Challenges of Outlier Detection 

- Modeling normal objects and outliers effectively
- Application-specific outlier detection
- Handling noise in outlier detection
- Understandability

## Outlier Detection Methods 549
- supervised
1. definition: Supervised methods model data normality and abnormality. Domain experts examine and label a sample of the underlying data. Outlier detection can then be modeled as a classification problem

2. challenges:
- In summary, supervised methods of outlier detection must be careful in how they train and how they interpret classification rates due to the fact that outliers are rare in
comparison to the other data samples

- Semi-Supervised  
- Unsupervised Methods
