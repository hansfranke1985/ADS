# Summary:

## Data Quality

- Accuracy => data was recorded correctly
- Completeness => all relevant data was recorded
- Uniqueness => Entities are recorded once
- Timeliness => the data is keep up to date
- Consistency => the data agrees with itself

# Outliers Detection

1. GLobal
2. Local

## Statistical Approaches

1. Parametric:

- Minimal likelihood Formula (X - mean ) / std ==> if the value is 3x more than std, there is an outlier


2. Non-Parametric:

- Histogram 
- Density 

## Distance Based Approaches

General Idea:  
- Judge a point based on the distance(s) to its neighbors
- Several variants proposed
Basic Assumption:  
- Normal data objects have a dense neighborhood
- Outliers are far apart from their neighbors, i.e., have a less dense neighborhood

## Density based approaches
General Idea:  
- Compare the density around a point with the density around its local neighbors
- The relative density of a point compared to its neighbors is computed as an outlier score
- Approaches essentially differ in how to estimate density
Basic Assumption:  
- The density around a normal data object is similar to the density around its neighbors
- The density around an outlier is considerably different to the density around its neighbors 

## Model base approaches

- Data points that do not conform to the fitting model are potential
outliers

- linear reg / logistic reg / ...


# Review
- Data quality: accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness,believability, interpretability
- Data cleaning: e.g. missing/noisy values, outliers
- Data integration from multiple sources:
- Entity identification problem
- Remove redundancies
- Detect inconsistencies
- Data reduction
- Dimensionality reduction
- Numerosity reduction
- Data compression
- Data transformation and data discretization
- Normalization


# Outliers

- 12.1.1 What Are Outliers? 544
An outlier is a data object that deviates significantly from the rest of the objects, as if it were generated by a different mechanism. For ease of presentation within this chapter, we may
refer to data objects that are not outliers as “normal” or expected data. Similarly, we may refer to outliers as “abnormal” data
