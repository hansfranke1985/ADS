# Summary:

## Data Quality

- Accuracy => data was recorded correctly
- Completeness => all relevant data was recorded
- Uniqueness => Entities are recorded once
- Timeliness => the data is keep up to date
- Consistency => the data agress with itself



# Outlier Detection

1. GLobal
2. Local

## Statistical Approaches

1. Parametrics:

- Minimal likelihood Formula (X - mean ) / std ==> if the value is 3x more than std, there is an outlier

## Distance Based Approaches

2. Non-Parametrics:

- Histogram
- Density 



#Review
- Data quality: accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness,believability, interpretability
• Data cleaning: e.g. missing/noisy values, outliers
• Data integration from multiple sources:
• Entity identification problem
• Remove redundancies
• Detect inconsistencies
• Data reduction
• Dimensionality reduction
• Numerosity reduction
• Data compression
• Data transformation and data discretization
• Normalization
