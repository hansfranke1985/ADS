# Summary:

## Data Quality

- Accuracy => data was recorded correctly
- Completeness => all relevant data was recorded
- Uniqueness => Entities are recorded once
- Timeliness => the data is keep up to date
- Consistency => the data agress with itself



# Outlier Detection

1. GLobal
2. Local

## Statistical Approaches

1. Parametrics:

- Minimal likelihood Formula (X - mean ) / std ==> if the value is 3x more than std, there is an outlier


2. Non-Parametrics:

- Histogram 
- Density 

## Distance Based Approaches

General Idea
- Judge a point based on the distance(s) to its neighbors
-  Several variants proposed
Basic Assumption
- Normal data objects have a dense neighborhood
- Outliers are far apart from their neighbors, i.e., have a less dense neighborhood

## Density based approaches
- General Idea
Compare the density around a point with the density around its local neighbors
The relative density of a point compared to its neighbors is computed as an
outlier score
Approaches essentially differ in how to estimate density
- Basic Assumption
The density around a normal data object is similar to the density around its
neighbors
The density around an outlier is considerably different to the density around its
neighbors 

## Model base approches

- Data points that do not conform to the fitting model are potential
outliers

- linear reg / logistic reg / ...


# Review
- Data quality: accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness,believability, interpretability
- Data cleaning: e.g. missing/noisy values, outliers
- Data integration from multiple sources:
- Entity identification problem
- Remove redundancies
- Detect inconsistencies
- Data reduction
- Dimensionality reduction
- Numerosity reduction
- Data compression
- Data transformation and data discretization
- Normalization
